Yulu Business Case- Electric Bike Renting Platform Usage EDA

## Summary
This analysis examines a dataset of hourly bicycle rentals spanning from January 1, 2011, to December 19, 2012, containing 10,886 rows and 12 attributes. Key findings indicate no missing or duplicate data. High correlations (>0.9) between 'registered' and 'count' and between 'temp' and 'atemp' suggest 'atemp' can be dropped. Temperature typically ranges from 1 to 41°C, with 80% of rentals occurring below 28°C. Wind speeds generally stay below 30 KMPH, and humidity ranges uniformly between 0% and 100%. 

Insights reveal 80% of casual users rent fewer than 60 bicycles, and 80% of registered users rent fewer than 220. Total rentals stay below 350 for 80% of the time. Most rentals occur during working days (68.1%) with holidays accounting for only 2.9%. Registered users dominate at 81.2%. Rentals peak in summer and fall (60%), with spring being the least favored (15%). Favorable weather conditions account for 70% of rentals.

Recommendations to enhance revenue include targeted marketing in fall and summer, introducing monthly memberships, weather-based promotional offers, and effective maintenance planning during low-demand months. Corporate tie-ups to promote environmental benefits and providing lightweight covers for bicycles during adverse weather conditions are also suggested.
